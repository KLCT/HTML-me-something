                <h1>Detroit: The Birthplace</h1>
                <p class="content">&ensp;&ensp;I was born in Detroit on June 7th, 1992. NASA's EUVE telescope was launched on this day. I too was launched into a new, cold, and unfamiliar world.</p>

                <h1><b>Memphis:</b> The Shortstop</h1>
                <p class="content">&ensp;&ensp;Due to an untimely fire, my family and I packed up and headed South. We stayed with my older sister in Elvis country. While living in Memphis, I learned all about the southern hospitality. In such a hot place, eveyone had a very warm and inviting disposition. In retrospect, the BBQ was 'OK', but more on BBQ related realizaions later.</p>

                <h1><b>Kansas City:</b> Home</h1>
                <p class="content">&ensp;&ensp;In 2004, my family decided to migrate back to the Midwest. We landed here in KC. KC has the best BBQ, in my opinion. I had BBQ as far north as New York, and no amount of sauce could disguise the bland flavorless pile. Memphis BBQ is tasty, and def worth trying on a trip, but not number 1. Maybe in the top 5 somewhere. I've had BBQ in Myrtle Beach, which was nothing to write home about. I won't detail my BBQ experience in Houston. There are so many options here in the city making a choice can be overwhelming! Here is my top 5 for some guidance: 
                    <br></br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(Oklahoma) Joe's</li>
                            <li>LC's</li>
                            <li>Big T's</li>
                            <li>Q 39</li>
                            <li>Gate's (an honorable mention of sorts)</li>
                        </ol>
